This is a backup for the two projects I have done for my university course of Web Application Development.

<intern-project-system> is to build a system to support Work Integrated Learning. This system allows industry partners to register projects for students, and students to apply to work on a project.

  -> The aim of this project is to build a simple web application with the basic building blocks (to a reasonable level). The only support from Laravel      framework you can use are routing, templating (view), and session. The understanding gained from this assignment provides a foundation for students to      learn other frameworks or to develop new frameworks.

<food-ordering-portal> is to create a food ordering portal (e.g. Menulog, Deliveroo, Uber Eats). With this portal, restaurants can list the dishes they want to sell. Customers can order selected dishes.
  
  -> The aim of this project is to demonstrate understanding of Laravelâ€™s migrations, seeders, models, ORM/Eloquent, route, controllers, validator, and          view/blade.
