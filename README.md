This is a backup for the two projects I have done for my university course of Web Application Development.

intern-project-system is to build a system to support Work Integrated Learning. This system allows industry partners to register projects for students, and students to apply to work on a project.

The aim of this assignment is to build a simple web application with the basic building blocks (to a reasonable level). The only support from Laravel framework you can use are routing, templating (view), and session. The understanding gained from this assignment provides a foundation for students to learn other frameworks or to develop new frameworks. In assignment 2, we will let you unleash the capabilities of Laravel.
